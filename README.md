# gRPC client in Scala

Small example app for a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) client written in Scala with the help of [ScalaPB](https://github.com/scalapb/ScalaPB). 

It spins up the client and executes some preconfigured requests against the gRPC server you can find [here](https://github.com/maoertel/grpc-server). No magic just to see how it works and interacts. Have a look at the `proto` files under `/protobuf`.
